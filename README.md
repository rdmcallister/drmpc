# drmpc: Distributionally Robust Model Predictive Control
``drmpc`` contains algorithms for formulating and solving distributionally robust model predictive control (DRMPC) problems through the convex optimization package ``cvxpy``. The DRMPC problem considers a linear system, with linear constraints and quadratic costs defined via the numpy arrays ``A B G C D b C_f b_f S h Q R P``. The linear system is defined as $x^+=Ax+Bu+Gw$ in which $x$ is the state, $u$ is the input, and $w$ is the disturbances. The linear constraints include a state/input constraint $Cx+Bu\leq b$, a terminal state constraint $C_fx \leq b_f$, and a polytopic support for the disturbance $Sw\leq h$. The quadratic stage cost is defined as $x'Qx+u'Ru$ and the terminal cost is defined as $x'Px$. The DRMPC problem considers the worst case distribution of $w$ in an ambiguity set containing all zero-mean distributions within a Gelbrich ball centered at the covariance $\Sigma$ with radius $\varepsilon$.
